# withreact

A demo of a Spring Boot application that also serves up a React application.

----------------------------------------------

My working notes:

https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app

npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start

When youâ€™re ready to deploy to production, running npm run build will create an optimized build of your app in the build folder. 

npm run build

to serve the static, built site:
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
